we need to have a way in order to tell if some "NICHE" is worth creating a channel about by looking at the data from an ai maybe, maybe use local llm to tell if a niche is good or not:

make llm/ai see and tell the trends in the video title names, any pattern it sees and its corresponding view count, so that it tells which video title and which niche will lend more views

the channel age, the video upload frequency
