we need to have a way in order to tell if some "NICHE" is worth creating a channel about by looking at the data from an ai maybe, maybe use local llm to tell if a niche is good or not:

make llm/ai see and tell the trends in the video title names, any pattern it sees and its corresponding view count, so that it tells which video title and which niche will lend more views

the channel age, the video upload frequency

from moviepy.editor import VideoFileClip, ImageClip, CompositeVideoClip

# Load the video clip
video_clip = VideoFileClip("input_video.mp4")

# Load the watermark image
watermark = ImageClip("watermark.png")

# Resize the watermark to fit a specific portion of the video
watermark = watermark.resize(height=50)

# Define the position of the watermark (e.g., bottom-right corner)
watermark_position = (video_clip.size[0] - watermark.size[0] - 10, video_clip.size[1] - watermark.size[1] - 10)

# Overlay the watermark onto the video
video_with_watermark = CompositeVideoClip([video_clip, watermark.set_position(watermark_position).set_duration(video_clip.duration)])

# Save the edited video
video_with_watermark.write_videofile("output_video_with_watermark.mp4")
